 <p>My name is Sean and I’m working on completing a web development transfer degree. More importantly, I’m working towards finally getting my foot in the door of the tech industry as a developer. I’ve been learning how to code for years now and recently I’ve been a lot more consistent. 
</p>
<p>Once I get a hold on my schedule and get ahead in my classes I plan on starting a YouTube channel to document my journey into tech. When I’m not studying, or taking care of home obligations(being a dad) I love to work on creative projects ranging from shoe restoration to sewing and painting. </p>

 <p>I enjoy getting out of my home and riding my bike. Last summer I spent some time as a bike courier for UberEats, which was an awesome experience. I used to use a mountain bike I bought on craigslist for like $40 but upgraded to a Rad Power bike and giant delivery bag. </p>
